- Where to start
  - Same as always
  - First the HTML structure and content
  - Then styling
  - Then JavaScript
- Where to start with our JavaScript
  - What is the simplest action I can start with?
- How to get the team name to change
  - Basically the same thing, but we need to find the `input` tag and get it's `value` attribute to know the team name to use
- How to find elements in our JavaScript
  - document.querySelector
- "main is not defined" aka how to debug errors
  - don't delete the main function, it is your friend
